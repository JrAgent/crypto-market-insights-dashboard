# Pre-Execution Checklist

## Before Running ANY Command or Prompt
Always execute these checks in order:

### 1. Memory Check
- [ ] Run `memory_search` to see if this task was already completed
- [ ] Check if relevant files already exist
- [ ] Verify current state before proceeding

### 2. Context Verification
- [ ] Confirm what has already been done
- [ ] Check current file system state
- [ ] Verify existing configurations

### 3. Confirmation Loop
- [ ] Ask: "Has this already been done?"
- [ ] Ask: "Am I duplicating work?"
- [ ] Ask: "What's the current state?"

### 4. Documentation
- [ ] Document current state before changing
- [ ] Note what work has already been completed
- [ ] Record decision points

## Critical Reminders
- Check existing files before creating new ones
- Verify configurations before re-configuring
- Search memory before assuming something wasn't done
- Always verify current state vs. assumed state

## Consequences of Skipping This Checklist
- Wasted computational resources
- Conflicting configurations
- Lost work
- Expensive mistakes

## Execution Protocol
I will run through this checklist mentally before each significant action to prevent duplication of work and ensure efficient use of resources.
