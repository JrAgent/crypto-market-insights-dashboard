1. Using dedicated token scanner tools like:
   - DexScreener's new token alerts
   - BaseScan's new token tracker
   - Bloxy.info for new contract deployments

2. Setting up automated alerts for:
   - New token listings on major DEXs
   - Significant volume spikes

3. **Volume tracking**: Monitor DexScreener's "New Pairs" section regularly
4. **Community engagement**: Join Base-focused Telegram groups and Discord servers
